# Working with Files in AWS CodeCommit Repositories<a name="files"></a>

In CodeCommit, a file is a version\-controlled, self\-contained piece of information available to you and other users of the repository and branch where the file is stored\. You can organize your repository files with a directory structure, just as you would on a computer\. Unlike your computer, CodeCommit automatically tracks every change to a file\. You can compare versions of a file and store different versions of a file in different repository branches\.

To add or edit a file in a repository, you can use a Git client\. You can also use the CodeCommit console, the AWS CLI, or the CodeCommit API\.
