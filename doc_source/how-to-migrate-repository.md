# Migrate to AWS CodeCommit<a name="how-to-migrate-repository"></a>

You can migrate a Git repository to an AWS CodeCommit repository in a number of ways: by cloning it, mirroring it, migrating all or just some of the branches, and so on\. You can also migrate local, unversioned content on your computer to AWS CodeCommit\.

The following topics demonstrate some of the ways you can choose to migrate a repository\. Your steps may vary, depending on the type, style, or complexity of your repository and the decisions you make about what and how you want to migrate\. For very large repositories, you might want to consider [migrating incrementally](how-to-push-large-repositories.md)\.

**Note**  
You can migrate to AWS CodeCommit from other version control systems, such as Perforce, Subversion, or TFS, but you will have to migrate to Git first\.   
For more options, see your Git documentation\.  
Alternatively, you can review the information about [migrating to Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-and-Other-Systems-Migrating-to-Git) in the *Pro Git* book by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub\.
