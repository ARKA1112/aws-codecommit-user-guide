# Data protection in AWS CodeCommit<a name="data-protection"></a>

CodeCommit repositories are automatically encrypted at rest\. No customer action is required\. CodeCommit also encrypts repository data in transit\. You can use either the HTTPS protocol, the SSH protocol, or both with CodeCommit repositories\. For more information, see [Setting up for AWS CodeCommit ](setting-up.md)\. You can also configure [cross\-account access](cross-account.md) to CodeCommit repositories\.
